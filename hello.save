Hi,

We have observed a consistently poor acceptance rate for Norway over the past few months, leading to significant financial losses, which we estimate to be in the millions. We have been in contact with Kustom, who provided us with data confirming this issue, and we have drawn the following conclusion:
We have compared the Swedish and Norwegian markets in terms of renewal acceptance rates over the past 60 days. The discrepancy between the two markets is highly concerning, with Norway's acceptance rate being significantly lower.
This is a matter of great urgency, and we expect you to respond immediately with a detailed plan on how you intend to resolve this issue, as well as the steps you will take to mitigate our losses going forward. It is unacceptable for a payment provider of your size—especially one approaching an IPO—to be experiencing such critical issues.
