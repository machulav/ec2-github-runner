branding:
  icon: 'box'
  color: 'orange'
inputs:
  mode:
    description: >-
      Specify here which mode you want to use:
        - 'start' - to start a new runner;
        - 'stop' - to stop the previously created runner.
    required: true
  github-token:
    description: >-
      GitHub Personal Access Token with the 'repo' scope assigned.
    required: true
  availability-zones-config:
    description: >-
      JSON string array of objects with configurations for multiple availability zones.
      Each object should contain 'imageId', 'subnetId', and 'securityGroupId'.
      Optionally, you can specify 'region' to launch the instance in a specific AWS region.
      If 'region' is not specified, the default AWS_REGION environment variable will be used.
      Example: '[{"imageId":"ami-123","subnetId":"subnet-123","securityGroupId":"sg-123"},{"imageId":"ami-456","subnetId":"subnet-456","securityGroupId":"sg-456","region":"us-west-2"}]'
      When provided, the action will try each configuration in sequence until a successful instance is launched.
      This takes precedence over individual ec2-image-id, subnet-id, and security-group-id parameters.
    required: false
  ec2-image-id:
    description: >-
      EC2 Image Id (AMI). The new runner will be launched from this image.
      This input is required if you use the 'start' mode and don't provide availability-zones-config.
    required: false
  ec2-instance-type:
    description: >-
      EC2 Instance Type.
      This input is required if you use the 'start' mode.
    required: false
  subnet-id:
    description: >-
      VPC Subnet Id. The subnet should belong to the same VPC as the specified security group.
      This input is required if you use the 'start' mode and don't provide availability-zones-config.
    required: false
  security-group-id:
    description: >-
      EC2 Security Group Id.
      The security group should belong to the same VPC as the specified subnet.
      The runner doesn't require any inbound traffic. However, outbound traffic should be allowed.
      This input is required if you use the 'start' mode and don't provide availability-zones-config.
    required: false
  label:
    description: >-
      Name of the unique label assigned to the runner.
      The label is used to remove the runner from GitHub when the runner is not needed anymore.
      This input is required if you use the 'stop' mode.
    required: false
  ec2-instance-id:
    description: >-
      EC2 Instance Id of the created runner.
      The id is used to terminate the EC2 instance when the runner is not needed anymore.
      This input is required if you use the 'stop' mode.
    required: false
  iam-role-name:
    description: >-
      IAM Role Name to attach to the created EC2 instance.
      This requires additional permissions on the AWS role used to launch instances.
    required: false
  aws-resource-tags:
    description: >-
      Tags to attach to the launched EC2 instance and volume.
      This must be a stringified array of AWS Tag objects, with both Key and Value fields,
      for example: '[{"Key": "TagKey1", "Value": "TagValue1"}, {"Key": "TagKey2", "Value": "TagValue2"}]'

outputs:
  label:
    description: >-
      Name of the unique label assigned to the runner.
      The label is used in two cases:
      - to use as the input of 'runs-on' property for the following jobs;
      - to remove the runner from GitHub when it is not needed anymore.
  ec2-instance-id:
    description: >-
      EC2 Instance Id of the created runner.
      The id is used to terminate the EC2 instance when the runner is not needed anymore.
  region:
